== Setup ==
To use the software, the computer must be connected to the scanner
such that the computer has the IP address 192.168.0.121.  You need
to specify how to find the scanner using arp

sudo arp -s 192.168.0.27 00:0F:CC:23:00:01

To test the scanner, you can grab a single frame using 

sudo ./spectroscan3d_grabframe frame.png

The scanner must be run as sudo in order to access the needed ports.
