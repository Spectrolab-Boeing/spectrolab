== Setup ==
To use the software, the computer must be connected to the scanner
such that the computer has the IP address 192.168.0.121.  You need
to specify how to find the scanner using arp

Unix  :  sudo arp -s 192.168.0.27 00:0F:CC:23:00:01
Windows  :   arp -s 192.168.0.27  00-0F-CC-23-00-01

This needs to be done everytime the system is started.

All programs that use the scanner must currently be run as Administrator 
or root user because the system uses low port numbers.

To view a live point cloud stream:

sudo ./spectroscan3d_simple_viewer

To test the scanner, you can grab a single frame using 

sudo ./spectroscan3d_grabpcd  frame
